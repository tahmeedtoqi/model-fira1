# model-fira1
#task to do :
# the training code is created to run in kaggle notebook with gpu. The model and its training code works fine and train the model on a single gpu p100.
#However kaggle does also offer 2 T4 gpu , so what i want is to modify the training code and (model code if nedded only) to combine the computational power and memory (14 GB + 14GB) to use them combinely train the model. my higest priority is to make it work in kaggle in T4 gpus.

#here is the dataset link i have used : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vadimkurochkin/openwebtext
